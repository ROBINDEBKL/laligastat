CSCI 4961 Open Source Software@RPI, 2019 summer.

### LICENSE

In this project, we are using MIT license (pretty loose).


### PROJECT

We construct a network to store statistics of players and teams in La Liga in the season of 19/20. It is open source in a way every one can contribute the data collection and inquires of certain operations. For example, the performance statistics, transfer, match schedules are the key components for the network. Everyone would be able to find their data for free.

For the add-on function, we would like to incorporate the two dimensions of comparisions: one player versus another player in terms of certain features, and one player's statistics with respect of time. For example, we could provide the physical condition of a player as the season proceeds. Moreover, we could have AI-infused technology to predict the results of one player or season. With recurrent neural network, we can apply deep learning to certain statistics along the time axis and provide some sort of inferences or conclusion to any interested users.


### BUSINESS MODEL

Out business model is based on MIT license (expat), and we are making profit by providing additional support to users. The base network is open-source, and everyone has the access to it. But in order to get premium support and more intricate statistics, they need to pay.
